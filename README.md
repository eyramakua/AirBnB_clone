Description of Project
For this task, we are tasked to build our first full web application:
the Airbnb clone. This task is crucial as the knowledge gained here will help
build the following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

We were assigned to:
Create a parent class (called BaseModel) which will take care of the
initialization, serialization, and deserialization of your future instances.
Create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file.
Create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel.
Create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
Create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engin


Description of Command Line Interpreter:
A command interpreter, often referred to as a command-line interpreter (CLI)
or shell, is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with a computer
or software by entering commands.

How to Start a Command Interpreter:
Windows:
On Windows, you can use the Command Prompt (cmd) or PowerShell.
Press Win + R to open the Run dialog, type cmd or powershell, and press Enter.
Linux/Unix:

On Linux or Unix-based systems, you can use the Terminal.
You can typically find it in the system applications menu, or use a keyboard shortcut like Ctrl + Alt + T.
macOS:

On macOS, you can use the Terminal.
You can find it in the Utilities folder within the
Applications folder, or use Spotlight (Cmd + Space) to search for it.

How to Use a Command Interpreter:
Enter Commands:

Once the command interpreter is open, you can type commands directly into the terminal or command prompt.
Navigate Directories:

Use commands like cd to change directories.
Execute Programs:

Run executable programs by typing their names.
View and Edit Files:

Use commands like cat, ls, dir, nano, or vim to view or edit files.
Manage Files and Directories:

Use commands like mkdir to create directories, rm or del to remove files, and cp or copy to copy files.
Get Help:

Use --help or -h with commands to get information on how to use them.

Examples:
Navigate Directories: cd Documents

List Files:ls - # On Linux/Unix, dir - # On Windows

Create a Directory: mkdir NewDirectory

Copy Files: cp file.txt backup/

Run a Python Script: python script.py

View File Content:cat readme.txt - # On Linux/Unix, type readme.txt - # On Windows

Remove a File: rm file.txt - # On Linux/Unix, del file.txt - # On Windows
